        <h3>What actually is AI, and why does everyone suddenly care?</h3>
        <p>AI (especially tools like ChatGPT) is a type of software that can understand language, generate content, answer questions, and summarize or organize information — fast.</p>
        <p>What changed recently is how usable it became. It's no longer for labs or developers. Now, anyone can use it to draft emails, summarize meetings, answer questions, or automate repeatable work.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this just another tech fad?</h3>
        <p>No — but the hype can make it feel that way.</p>
        <p>AI won't replace every job or transform every business overnight. But it's already changing how fast companies write, decide, respond, and operate. It's real leverage — especially in communication-heavy or document-heavy roles.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>We're not a tech company. Is AI even relevant for us?</h3>
        <p>Yes — especially if your team:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sends emails</li>
          <li>Runs meetings</li>
          <li>Answers recurring questions</li>
          <li>Handles SOPs, policies, or compliance documents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don't need to "be tech" to benefit. You just need pain points that AI can smooth out — which most growing companies have.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I know if we're "falling behind" on AI?</h3>
        <p>You don't need a lab. You just need awareness and intent.</p>
        <p>You're behind if your teams are still manually handling things AI could automate — or if people are experimenting on their own without visibility or consistency. You're ahead if you're thinking clearly and moving deliberately.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are small, realistic ways to start using AI in our business?</h3>
        <p>A few low-lift examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A bot that answers HR or IT questions from your actual handbook</li>
          <li>A tool that auto-summarizes leadership meetings</li>
          <li>A system that drafts sales outreach emails based on CRM activity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these can be set up in &lt;2 weeks with minimal change management.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I used ChatGPT to plan a vacation — neat. But how does this scale to a real business?</h3>
        <p>ChatGPT is a sandbox. Trivance builds custom GPTs trained on your business — your policies, your docs, your style.</p>
        <p>Think of the difference like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ChatGPT says: "Here's a general PTO policy."</li>
          <li>Your bot says: "Based on our Q4 policy, you can roll over 3 days through January 15."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Same tech, radically more useful.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's the biggest risk with AI?</h3>
        <p>Two risks:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Doing nothing — and letting small inefficiencies multiply.</li>
          <li>Unstructured use — where employees use AI tools with no oversight, which can lead to inconsistent messaging, security gaps, or compliance issues.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The middle path is best: start smart, move fast, build with guardrails.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is AI secure? What about private company data?</h3>
        <p>We use AI tools that can run inside your company's environment — no external data sharing required.</p>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No sensitive data goes to public ChatGPT or open APIs</li>
          <li>Only your people can access your models</li>
          <li>You choose what data is included, what's off-limits, and how it's used</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AI is as secure as the boundaries you define — and we build around those boundaries.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can AI replace employees?</h3>
        <p>Maybe — but at this stage, it's really more about changing how your people work.</p>
        <p>AI is best at:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generating first drafts</li>
          <li>Summarizing, tagging, or organizing</li>
          <li>Handling low-judgment, repetitive tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It frees up your people to do higher-value work. Smart orgs use it to amplify good people, not cut heads.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I just want to understand this better before making any decisions?</h3>
        <p>That's exactly what our Clarity Sprint is for.</p>
        <p>It's a fast, focused engagement where we:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify where AI could actually help in your business</li>
          <li>Map pain points to real solutions</li>
          <li>Deliver a clear, no-jargon plan with next steps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don't need to commit — just explore with intelligence.</p>
